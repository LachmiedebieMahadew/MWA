 Explain how does this function affect the event loop
answer of exercise 1:
console. log("Start"); this is a synchronous call so this prints start on the console.
console.log([1,3,4,2,1,5].removeNum(1)); is an asynchronous call because the removeNum method 
returns an promise object. so the browser executes the rest of the line of codes that appear 
 after this one synchronously while letting this line beining handled by the web Api who pushes the removeNum
 function to the calback or task queue.
console.log("Finish"); this is printed after start while the browser is waiting for the result of the promise.





Explain which one of the three is asynchronous
answer of exercise 2:
Promise and Await are code structures to write asynchronous code
